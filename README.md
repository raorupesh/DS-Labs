## Overview
In this repository, we explore and implement key concepts of distributed systems including fault tolerance, consensus algorithms, scalability, and performance optimizations. Each assignment is tackled with best practices, such as designing for high availability, fault-tolerant architecture, and optimizing network and computational resources for better system performance.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Socket Connection
This assignment involves implememtation of  a simple client that connects to a Group Coordinator Daemon (GCD) which will respond with a list of potential group members. The client then sends a message to each of the group members, prints out their response, and then exits.

### Assignment 2: Bully Algorithm
This assignment focuses on building a group which will be fully interconnected (like a round table) and will endeavor to choose a leader using the bully algorithmLinks to an external site.

### Assignment 3: Publish Subscribe
This assignment involves implementing a process that listens to currency exchange rates from a price feed and prints out a message whenever there is an arbitrage opportunity available.

### Assignment 4: Dynamic Hash Table
This assignment involves designing and implementing a Chord System, which allows nodes to join in a network, updates finger table and lets you query for data using a key.

### Assignment 5:Blockchain
This assignment involves designing and implementing to get an old block from the BitCoin block chain and demonstrate how any changes would be caught by the BitCoin network.


### Prerequisites
To run the assignments, ensure that the following tools are installed:
- Python 3
